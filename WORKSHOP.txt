Project any program on a in-game ProjectionScreen. You'll need a second monitor to display the window which will be captured. This plugin starts a background process which is basically Snipping Tool at 30 FPS. Also download Five Pebbles Pong, because this plugin is programmed as an add-on game.

This may not work on all PC's. If you don't get any output, check if you have .NET Runtime 6.0.15 installed: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

Known bugs/issues:
- Flashing "ghost" window in bottom left corner, fixing this would require rewriting relatively complex parts of the plugin.
- Max framerate is limited by the game's tick rate (40 fps).
